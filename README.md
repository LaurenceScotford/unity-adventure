# unity-adventure
A conversion of the Will Crowther / Don Woods classic text adventure (v2.5 430 points) created with Unity

This project is a coding exercise in Unity that didn't require creation of any graphic or audio assets. It was inspired by a Unity Learn recorded video session on how to build a [text adventure in Unity](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/recorded-video-session-text-adventure-game-part-1).

I used Don Wood's own conversion to C as a source. You can find a link to this in the Interactive Fiction Archive on [Rick Adam's Colossal Cave web page](https://rickadams.org/adventure/e_downloads.html).
