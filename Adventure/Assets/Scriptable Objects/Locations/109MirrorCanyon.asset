  longDescription: "You are in a north/south canyon about 25 feet across. The floor
    is covered by white mist seeping in from the north. The walls extend\r upward
    for well over 100 feet.  Suspended from some unseen point far above you, an enormous
    two-sided mirror is hanging parallel to and midway between the canyon walls.
    (The mirror is obviously provided for the use of the dwarves who, as you know,
    are extremely vain.) A\r small window can be seen in either wall, some fifty
    feet up."
  shortDescription: You're in Mirror Canyon.
