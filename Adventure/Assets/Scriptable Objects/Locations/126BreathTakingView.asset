  longDescription: You are on the edge of a breath-taking view. Far below you is
    an active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging out, cascading
    back down into the depths. The glowing rock fills the farthest reaches of the
    cavern with a blood-red glare, giving everything an eerie, macabre appearance.
    The air is filled with flickering sparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone.
    The walls are hot to the touch, and the thundering of the volcano drowns out
    all other sounds. Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted
    formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky light into
    sinister apparitions upon the walls. To one side is a deep gorge, filled with
    a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to have been crafted by the devil
    himself. An immense river of fire crashes out from the depths of the volcano,
    burns its way through the gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to
    your left. To the right, an immense geyser of blistering steam erupts continuously
    from a barren island in the center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles ominously.
    The far right wall is aflame with an incandescence of its own, which lends an
    additional infernal splendor to the already hellish scene. A dark, foreboding
    passage exits to the south.
  shortDescription: You're at breath-taking view.
