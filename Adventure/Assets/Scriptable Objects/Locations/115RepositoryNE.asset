  longDescription: "You are at the northeast end of an immense room, even larger
    than the Giant Room. It appears to be a repository for the \"Adventure\" program.
    Massive torches far overhead bathe the room with smoky yellow light. Scattered
    about you can be seen a pile of bottles (all\r of them empty), a nursery of young
    beanstalks murmuring quietly, a bed of oysters, a bundle of black rods with rusty
    stars on their ends, and a collection of brass lanterns. Off to one side a great
    many dwarves are sleeping on the floor, snoring loudly. A notice nearby reads:
    \"Do not disturb the dwarves!\" An immense mirror is hanging against one wall,
    and stretches to the other end of the room, where various other sundry objects
    can be glimpsed dimly in the distance."
  shortDescription: You're at ne end.
