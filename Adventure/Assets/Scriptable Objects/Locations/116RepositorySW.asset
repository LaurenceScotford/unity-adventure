  longDescription: You are at the southwest end of the repository. To one side is
    a pit full of fierce green snakes. On the other side is a row of small wicker
    cages, each of which contains a little sulking bird. In one corner is a bundle
    of black rods with rusty marks on their ends. A large number of velvet pillows
    are scattered about on the floor. A vast mirror stretches off to the northeast.
    At your feet is a large steel grate, next to which is a sign that reads, "Treasure
    Vault. Keys in main office."
  shortDescription: You're at sw end.
