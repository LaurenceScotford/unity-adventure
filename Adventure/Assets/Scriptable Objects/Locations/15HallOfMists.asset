  longDescription: You are at one end of a vast hall stretching forward out of sight
    to the west. There are openings to either side. Nearby, a wide stone staircase
    leads downward. The hall is filled with wisps of white mist swaying to and fro
    almost as if alive. A cold wind blows up the staircase. There is a passage at
    the top of a dome behind you.
  shortDescription: You're in Hall of Mists.
