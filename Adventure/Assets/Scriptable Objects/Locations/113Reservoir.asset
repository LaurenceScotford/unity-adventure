  longDescription: You are at the edge of a large underground reservoir. An opaque
    cloud of white mist fills the room and rises rapidly upward. The lake is fed
    by a stream, which tumbles out of a hole in the wall about 10 feet overhead and
    splashes noisily into the water somewhere within the mist. There is a passage
    going back toward the south.
  shortDescription: You're at reservoir.
