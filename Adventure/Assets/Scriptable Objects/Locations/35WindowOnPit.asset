  longDescription: You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends up
    out of sight. A floor is indistinctly visible over 50 feet below. Traces of white
    mist cover the floor of the pit, becoming thicker to the right. Marks in the
    dust around the window would seem to indicate that someone has been here recently.
    Directly across the pit from you and 25 feet away there is a similar window looking
    into a lighted room. A shadowy figure can be seen there peering back at you.
  shortDescription: You're at window on pit.
