  longDescription: You are at the base of a nearly vertical cliff. There are some
    slim footholds which would enable you to climb up, but it looks extremely dangerous.
    Here at the base of the cliff lie the remains of several earlier adventurers
    who apparently failed to make it.
  shortDescription: You're at base of cliff.
