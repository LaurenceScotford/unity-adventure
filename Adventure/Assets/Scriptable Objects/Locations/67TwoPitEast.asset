  longDescription: You are at the east end of the Twopit Room. The floor here is
    littered with thin rock slabs, which make it easy to descend the pits. There
    is a path here bypassing the pits to connect passages from east and west. There
    are holes all over, but the only big one is on the wall directly over the west
    pit where you can't get to it.
  shortDescription: You're at east end of Twopit Room.
