  message: "I know of places, actions, and things. Most of my vocabulary describes
    places and is used to move you there. To move, try words like forest, building,
    downstream, enter, east, west, north, south, up, or down.\n\nI know about a few
    special objects, like a black rod hidden in the cave. These objects can be manipulated
    using some of the action words that I know. Usually you will need to give both
    the object and action words (in either order), but sometimes I can infer the
    object from the verb alone. Some objects also imply verbs; in particular, \"inventory\"
    implies \"take inventory\", which causes me to give you a list of what you're
    carrying. Some objects have unexpected effects; the effects are not always desirable!
    \n\nUsually people having trouble moving just need to try a few more words. Usually
    people trying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are attempting something
    beyond their (or my!) capabilities and should try a completely different tack.
    One point often confusing to beginners is that, when there are several ways to
    go in a certain direction (e.g., if there are several holes in a wall), choosing
    that direction in effect chooses one of the ways at random; often, though, by
    specifying the place you want to reach you can guarantee choosing the right path.\n\nAlso,
    to speed the game you can sometimes move long distances with a single word. 
    For example, \"building\" usually gets you to the building from anywhere above
    ground except when lost in the forest.  Also, note that cave passages and forest
    paths turn a lot, so leaving one place heading north doesn't guarantee entering
    the next from the south.\n\nHowever (another important point), except when you've
    used a \"long distance\" word such as \"building\", there is always a way to
    go back where you just came from unless I warn you to the contrary, even though
    the direction that takes you back might not be the reverse of what got you here.
    \n\nGood luck, and have fun!"
