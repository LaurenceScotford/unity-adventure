  message: "If you want to save your game so you can stop playing for now and come
    back to it later, simply return to the menu and I will automatically save your
    progress. If, however, you want to create a saved file at this specific point
    in the game that you can restore later, e.g. if things don't go as you hoped,
    I can do that for you, but\r it will cost you 5 points.\r"
