  message: "The trees of the forest are large hardwood oak and maple, with an\r occasional
    grove of pine or spruce. There is quite a bit of undergrowth, largely birch and
    ash saplings plus nondescript bushes of various sorts. This time of year visibility
    is quite restricted by all the leaves, but travel is quite easy if you detour
    around the spruce and berry bushes."
