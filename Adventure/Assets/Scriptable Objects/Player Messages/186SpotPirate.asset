  message: There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you. As you turn
    toward them, the beam of your lamp falls across a bearded pirate. He is carrying
    a large chest. "Shiver me timbers!" he cries, "I've been spotted!  I'd best hie
    meself off to the maze to hide me chest!" With that, he vanishes into the gloom.
