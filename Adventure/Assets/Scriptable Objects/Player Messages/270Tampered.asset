  message: A dark fog creeps in to surround you. From somewhere in the fog you hear
    a stern voice. "This Adventure has been tampered with! You have been dabbling
    in magic, knowing not the havoc you might cause thereby. Leave at once, before
    you do irrevocable harm!" The fog thickens, until at last you can see nothing
    at all. Your vision then clears, and you find yourself back in The Real World.
