  message: 'Somewhere nearby is Colossal Cave, where others have found fortunes in
    treasure and gold, though it is rumored that some who enter are never seen again.
    Magic is said to work in the cave.


    I will be your eyes and hands. Direct
    me with commands of 1 or 2 words. I should warn you that I look at only the first
    five letters of each word, so you''ll have to enter "northeast" as "ne" to distinguish
    it from "north".


    You can type "help" for some general hints. For information
    on how to end your adventure, scoring, etc., type "info".


    This program
    was originally developed by Willie Crowther. Most of the features of the current
    program were added by Don Woods. This conversion of Adventure 2.5 (Don Wood''s
    430 point version) to Unity is by Laurence Scotford.'
