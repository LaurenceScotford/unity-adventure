  message: "As you rub the urn, there is a flash of light and a genie appears. His
    aspect is stern as he advises: \"One who wouldst traffic in precious stones must
    first learn to recognize the signals thereof.\" He wrests the urn from the stone,
    leaving a small cavity. Turning to face you again, he fixes you with a steely
    eye and intones: \"Caution!\" Genie and urn vanish in a cloud of amber smoke.
    The smoke condenses\r to form a rare amber gemstone, resting in the cavity in
    the rock."
