  message: "Version 2.5 is essentially the same as Version II; the cave and the hazards
    therein are unchanged, and top score is still 430 points. There are a few more
    hints, especially for some of the more obscure puzzles. There are a few minor
    bugfixes and cosmetic changes. You\r can now save a game and resume it at once
    (formerly you had to wait a while first), but it now costs you a few points each
    time you save the game. Saved games are now stored in much smaller files than
    before.\n\nNOTE from Laurence Scotford: The original note above has been included
    here for historic interest, but the information about bug fixes and save files
    doesn't apply to this recreation of the original game.\n"
