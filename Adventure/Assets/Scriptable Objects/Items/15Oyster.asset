  descriptions:
  - There is an enormous oyster here with its shell tightly closed.
  - 'Interesting. There seems to be something written on the underside of the oyster. '
  - Even though it's an oyster, the critter's as tight-mouthed as a clam.
  - It says the same thing it did before. Hm, maybe it's a pun?
