  descriptions:
  - There is a tiny little plant in the pit, murmuring "water, water, ..."
  - There is a 12-foot-tall beanstalk stretching up out of the pit, bellowing "WATER!!
    WATER!!"
  - There is a gigantic beanstalk stretching all the way up to the hole.
  - The plant spurts into furious growth for a few seconds.
  - The plant grows explosively, almost filling the bottom of the pit.
  - You've over-watered the plant! It's shriveling up! And now . . .
  - The plant continues to ask plaintively for water.
  - The plant continues to demand water.
  - The plant now maintains a contented silence.
